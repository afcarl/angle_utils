angle_utils
===========

Pure python operations common to angles. Angles exist on a manifold and hence typical simple arithmetic operations (like averaging) can horribly go wrong if care if not taken. This is a start of a collection of simple functions to handling these.


### Features

Growing list of:

- [x] Normalization of angles
- [x] Addition (result properly within 0 - 2pi range)
- [x] Subtraction (result properly within 0 - 2pi range)
- [ ] Mapping on to other ranges
- [ ] Binning/histograms
- [ ] more ...


### Contributing
This is very experimental code (midly tested in my own research applications)
