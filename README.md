angle_utils
===========

Pythonic angles common operations. Angles are on a manifold and hence typical simple arithmetic operations can horribly go wrong if care if not taken. This is a start of a collection of simple functions to handling these.

## Features
- [x] Normalization of angles
- [x] Addition (result properly within 0 - 2pi range)
- [x] Subtraction (result properly within 0 - 2pi range)
- [ ] Mapping on to other ranges
- [ ] Binning/histograms
- [ ] ...
- [ ] 


## Contributing
This is very experimental code (midly tested in my own research applications)
